<p class="apology text-lg mb-4 fade-in">
From the moment we spoke after meeting at "Duke's there has been a tie between us. The endless hours we spent getting to know each other, the laughter echoing in the night club. Our courtship was a whirlwind of long-distance calls and cherished visits, each one solidifying a joy and connection that felt unbreakable. Over the years, that connection, though not completely severed, has been damaged.
</p>
<p class="apology text-lg mb-4 fade-in">
Love, as I reflect on the years we've spent together, my heart is heavy with a deep apology. I am so sorry for the times I've taken you for granted, for not making you feel as loved and cherished as you truly are, and for not being a better version of myself with you. You deserve so much more than the complacency you have sometimes received, and for that, I am truly sorry.
</p>

<p class="text-base mb-4 fade-in">
This day is more than just a date on the calendar. It is a day that holds a sacrificial connotation, a testament to the promises we made and the sacrifices that follow. It’s a celebration of the commitment we entered into—a commitment that required you to sacrifice your physical presence, your time, and your provisions to be accountable to our family. I see that sacrifice, I understand it, and I want you to know how deeply I appreciate it.
</p>

<p class="text-base mb-4 fade-in">
I am also profoundly apologetic for any moment you have not felt that I am a safe place to communicate. I would surely desire that you feel  that space and time where you can be completely yourself, where your words are always heard and honored, and where vulnerability is a cornerstone of our trust. I am committed to doing better, to being the soft place to land that you need and deserve.
</p>

<p class="text-base mb-6 fade-in">
Even with the passage of time, this day will always be a special symbol of our union. But you, my love, mean so much more to me than a singular day in the calendar. You are the origin, the foundation, and the ever-growing force of our family and our love. I want every single day with you to feel like you are winning with us. Because you are everything to me.
</p>

<p class="text-base mb-4 fade-in">I ask a beautiful question? : "Can a mended connection be authentic, committed, whole, and true?" My heart's answer is a resounding yes. I believe that a connection, when it is lovingly and intentionally repaired, can become stronger than it was before. The journey of mending requires a deeper kind of vulnerability and trust, and it is in this process that we can truly see each other, forgive, and commit to a love that is whole precisely because it has been tested and healed. Only I cannot answer for you. What do you feel?
